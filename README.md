# google-homepage

#This is a sample site for google, created 2/22, finished 2/23, and using code from https://codepen.io/mnimmz/pen/yJwBYp to help me along. 

#Used this to learn about creating a nav bar, header, footer, and made some dummy html in the nav bar to make sure I understood. 

#Pulled, branched, merged, and pushed using Git.
